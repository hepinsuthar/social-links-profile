## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me understand better how to structure a responsive card layout using Tailwind CSS. I also reinforced my understanding of @font-face, custom Tailwind configurations, and creating reusable utility-first components.

```html
<p class="city text-base font-semibold mt-1.5">London, United Kingdom</p>
```

### Continued development

In the future, I want to:

- Deepen my understanding of accessibility practices (WCAG)
- Add dark/light theme toggling
- Try building a React version of the same project

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Essential for learning and referencing utilities
- [Frontend Mentor Slack Community](https://frontendmentor.io/community) - Great place to get help and inspiration
